# Resistor-Codes


This command line application converts between resistor values and color codes, quickly and easily.

```
Usage: java resistor {value | color} { resistance_value [tolerance] | color1 color2 color3 color4 }
```

### TODO:
* Fix potential errors from strange and impossible inputs
* Make the ValueToColor round UP to the nearest common multiple of resistor
* Add support for more than 4-color resistors
