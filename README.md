Resistor-Codes
==============

This command line application converts between resistor values and color codes, quickly and easily.
View this in RAW form to see the usage properly. I have no idea how to format this for gitHub
Usage: "java resistor <value | color> < <resistance_value> [tolerance] | <color1> <color2> <color3> <color4> >"
